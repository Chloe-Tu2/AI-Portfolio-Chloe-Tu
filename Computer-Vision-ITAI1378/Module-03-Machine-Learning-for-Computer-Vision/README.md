## Module 03: Classical Machine Learning for Computer Vision
**Files:** `L03_A_Chloe_Tu_ITAI_1378.ipynb`, `L03_B_Chloe_Tu_ITAI_1378.ipynb`
Before diving into Deep Learning, I mastered classical ML techniques to understand the foundations of vision.
* **Project:** Built a classifier for the CIFAR-10 dataset.
* **Feature Extraction:** Explored HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) and SIFT to convert images into meaningful vector data.
* **Models:** Trained Support Vector Machines (SVM) using Scikit-Learn.
* **Insight:** Learned that while classical models are interpretable, they struggle with raw pixel data compared to Deep Learning approaches.
