## Module 02: Fundamentals of Image Processing (Pixels to Perception)
**Files:** `L02_Tu_Chloe_ITAI1378.ipynb`, `A02_Chloe_Tu_Group_01.pdf`
**Theme:** "Detective Max Contrast: Pixels in the Shadows"
This project moved beyond basic coding by applying a creative "Detective Noir" narrative to technical concepts.
* **Implementation:** I utilized Python and OpenCV to treat images as numerical matrices.
* **Techniques:** Implemented Histogram Equalization (to fix "dark" images), Gaussian Blurring, and Sharpening.
* **Reflection:** Viewed image filters not just as functions, but as mathematical tools to reveal hidden data within a digital signal.
