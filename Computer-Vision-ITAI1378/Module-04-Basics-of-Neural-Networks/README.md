## Module 04: Introduction to Neural Networks (PyTorch)
**Files:** `L04_Chloe_Tu_ITAI_1378.ipynb`, `L04_Chloe_Tu_ITAI_1378.pdf`
**Project:** Chihuahua vs. Muffin (Binary Classification)
This module introduced Deep Learning frameworks using PyTorch.
* **Architecture:** Built a simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with linear layers, ReLU activation, and Softmax.
* **Process:** Implemented the full training loop: Forward pass, Loss calculation (CrossEntropy), and Backpropagation.
* **Result:** The simple NN struggled to distinguish between look-alike images (Chihuahuas and Muffins), highlighting the need for spatial awareness in models.
