## Module 05: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
**Files:** `Lab05_CNN_Chihuahua_Muffin.ipynb`, `L05_Chloe_Tu_ITAI_1378.pdf`
To improve upon the Module 04 results, I implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
* **Architecture Change:** Replaced linear layers with Convolutional layers (Conv2d) and Pooling layers to detect spatial features like edges and textures.
* **Performance:** The CNN significantly outperformed the standard NN by preserving the spatial relationship of pixels.
* **Challenges:** Encountered and addressed "Overfitting" by discussing strategies like data augmentation and dropout.
