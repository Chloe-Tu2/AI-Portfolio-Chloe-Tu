## Module 08: Visual Language Models (VLMs)
**Files:** `L08_Chloe_Tu_ITAI1378.ipynb`
This advanced module explored the cutting edge of "Multimodal AI"—systems that understand both text and images.
* **Models:** Worked with CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) and BLIP.
* **Applications:** Implemented Zero-Shot Classification (classifying images without explicit training labels) and Image Captioning.
* **Outcome:** Gained an understanding of how modern AI bridges the gap between natural language processing and computer vision.
