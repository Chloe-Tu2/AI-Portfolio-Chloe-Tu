## Module 06: Hardware Acceleration & GPU Setup
**Files:** `L06_Chloe_Tu_ITAI1378.ipynb`
Deep Learning requires significant computational power. In this module, I learned to manage hardware resources within Google Colab.
* **Skills:** Verifying CUDA availability, checking GPU device names in TensorFlow/PyTorch, and ensuring the environment is optimized for training heavy models.
